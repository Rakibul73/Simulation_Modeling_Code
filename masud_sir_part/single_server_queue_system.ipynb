    "The `customer_arrival` method is a generator function that simulates customer arrivals. It runs indefinitely in a loop (`while True`). Inside the loop, the function `yield` pauses the execution for a random time interval based on an exponential distribution with the specified arrival rate (`random.expovariate(self.arrival_rate)`). This simulates the inter-arrival time between consecutive customers. After a customer arrives, we increment the queue length by one (`self.queue_length += 1`), and then we start the customer service process using `self.env.process(self.customer_service(self.env.now))`. The `self.env.now` captures the current simulation time, representing the time of customer arrival.\n",

    "The `customer_service` method simulates the service process for a customer. It starts by capturing the arrival time passed as `arrival_time`. The service time is sampled from an exponential distribution with the specified service rate (`random.expovariate(self.service_rate)`). We then yield `self.env.timeout(service_time)`, which represents the duration of the service. After the service is completed, the departure time is captured as the current simulation time (`self.env.now`), and we calculate the waiting time as `waiting_time = departure_time - arrival_time`. We decrement the queue length by one (`self.queue_length -= 1`) and add the waiting time to the list of waiting times for customers (`self.waiting_times.append(waiting_time)`).\n",

    "After the simulation is complete, we calculate the average waiting time of customers using the recorded waiting times and print the result.\n",

It prints a message when the customer starts being served, and it yields the service process by calling `env.process(queue.service())`.
