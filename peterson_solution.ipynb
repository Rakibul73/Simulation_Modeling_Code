    "Peterson's Solution is a classic algorithm used to solve the critical-section problem in concurrent programming. The critical-section problem arises when multiple processes or threads need to access a shared resource (such as shared memory or a shared data structure) concurrently. To prevent data inconsistency and ensure the correctness of the program, mutual exclusion must be enforced, meaning only one process can access the shared resource at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peterson's Solution is based on the idea of using shared variables to coordinate the access to the critical section. It is primarily designed for systems with two processes that need to access a shared resource. The algorithm ensures that only one process is in its critical section at any given time, thus providing mutual exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm relies on the following shared variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int turn`: A variable that indicates whose turn it is to enter the critical section.\n",
    "- `bool flag[2]`: An array of flags that each process uses to indicate its intention to enter the critical section. `flag[i]` is true if process `i` wants to enter the critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of Peterson's Solution is that before entering the critical section, each process sets its `flag` to true and then sets `turn` to its own process number. Then it enters a loop where it checks if the other process also wants to enter the critical section. If the other process is in the critical section (indicated by its `flag` being true), and it has the turn (indicated by `turn` being equal to the other process number), the current process waits (spins) until it can enter the critical section. If not, it proceeds to enter its critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode for Peterson's Solution is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Shared variables\n",
    "int turn = 0\n",
    "bool flag[2] = {false, false}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process 0\n",
    "flag[0] = true\n",
    "turn = 1\n",
    "while flag[1] and turn == 1:\n",
    "    # Wait\n",
    "# Critical section\n",
    "# Exit section\n",
    "flag[0] = false\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process 1\n",
    "flag[1] = true\n",
    "turn = 0\n",
    "while flag[0] and turn == 0:\n",
    "    # Wait\n",
    "# Critical section\n",
    "# Exit section\n",
    "flag[1] = false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key property of Peterson's Solution is that it provides mutual exclusion, meaning only one process can be in its critical section at a time. Additionally, the algorithm guarantees progress, ensuring that a process that wants to enter the critical section will eventually do so as long as the other process does not remain indefinitely in its critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while Peterson's Solution is a simple and elegant algorithm, it is not suitable for scenarios with more than two processes."
